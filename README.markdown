Task description
----------------

The task is to implement a fraction calculator API such that the following can be achieved by a client using the API:

1.	All fractions are represented in the form of Numerator and Denominator, including results.
2.	Addition
3.	Subtraction
4.	Multiplication
5.	Division
6.	It is expected to throw correct exceptions.


Implement the API in a Visual Studio C# project and make it compile. If possible, make sure that at least part of the API is covered with unit tests.
